# Electronics tutorial

This repository serves as a go-to place for getting started with CAUV electronics. In this series of tutorials, you will first learn how to design useful real-life circuits with ICs and sensors. You will learn how to use KiCad to design circuit schematics, PCBs(Printed Circuit Boards) and generate Gerbers for manufacturing the PCBs. This series will also provide guidance on how to navigate through the sometimes incomprehensible datasheets of the components that you will be using.
