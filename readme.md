# CAUV Electronics Tutorial

## Overview 

This repository serves as a guide to get you started with CAUV electronics. In this series of tutorials, you will first learn how to design useful real-life circuits with ICs and sensors. You will also learn how to use KiCad to design circuit schematics, PCBs(Printed Circuit Boards) and generate Gerbers for manufacturing the PCBs. This series will also provide guidance on how to navigate through the sometimes incomprehensible datasheets of the components that you will be using. 

If you are an absolute beginner in electronics, ie. you only know fundamental theories like Ohm's law, then you can read the following [The Basics](#the-basics) section. Otherwise, feel free to skip to the next section on [KiCad](#kicad)
